One of the biggest change in Front-Commerce 3 is the introduction of TypeScript.
Whenever you're a Typescript evangelist or a vanilla Javascript defender, Typescript implemenetation
is a developer life enhancer.

## Typescript is FUN

When starting writing this blogpost, the first thing that came to my mind was this GIF:

If you're like me and you like writting code, you must have your favorite set of tools. Whatever IDE
you're using, you may use autocompletion. It helps you to write code faster, improving you're productivity and sometimes replace documentation.

As a personnal big fan of strongly typed languages, Typescript quickly became my friend in my daily programming tasks.

That's our love of Typescript that lead us to implement it in Front-Commerce 3, and leverage your developper experience.

Here's a quick tour of what's new for developper in Front-Commerce v3.

## Please welcome TSX !

You can now use TSX for your pages, components and hooks to strongly type your code.
Here's a simple example on how you can now type props in your components :

```tsx
import { FC } from "react";

interface MyComponentProps {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isATypescriptUser?: boolean;
}

const MyComponent: FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ name, age, isATypescriptUser }) => {
  return
    <>
      <h1>Hello {name} ! your age is {age}</h1>
      {isATypescriptUser ? "you're a Typescript user" : "you're not a Typescript user"}
    </>;
};
```

However if you don't feel confident with TSX, you can still use JSX or write non-typed code in TSX.

## Embrace Typescript Ecosystem

In the previous section, we've been using Typescript to declare props with an interface.

But now you're able to fully use Typescript ecosystem like these features:

* [Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)
* [Enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html)
* [Unions Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types)
* [Type Aliases](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-aliases)
* [Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html)

And more, see the [official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) to learn more about the power of Typescript.

## Thank you

I hope this little article was useful to you and get you hyped with Typescript.
And taht you'll be pleased to use it in Front-Commerce 3.

Happy coding !
