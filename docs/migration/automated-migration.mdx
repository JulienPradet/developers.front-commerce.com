### Scss updates

:::info Warning

When running codemods, you may see some warnings like this:

```
⚠️   No component found for '/home/pierre/Code/fc/pop-remixed/app/theme/components/templates/Grid/Grid'
⚠️   No component found for '/home/pierre/Code/fc/pop-remixed/app/theme/layouts/Footer/SocialLinkList'
⚠️   No component found for '/home/pierre/Code/fc/pop-remixed/app/theme/components/molecules/Form/FormActions/FormActions'
```

This means that you overriden styles without overriding its component. Usually,
for core components it's not a problem, but for custom styles you must ensure
that the stylesheet is being loaded somewhere.

--

Check `_components.scss` and others, to remove them after reimporting the styles
in related components.
